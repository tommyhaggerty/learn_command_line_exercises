# Chapter 6: List Directory (ls)

## Do More

### On Unix, try the ls -lR command while you're in temp.

    ran ls -lR, it appears to have listed all the directories and sub directories within the directory I am active in.
    It gives detailed data about each directory.

### Use cd to get to other directories on your computer then use ls to see what's in them.

    ran cd to go back to home directory
    ran ls on main directory

### Update your notebook with new questions. I know you probably have some, because I'm not covering everything about this command.

### Remember that if you get lost, then use ls and pwd to figure out where you are, then go to where you need to be with cd.
