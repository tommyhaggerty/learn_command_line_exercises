# Chapter 4: Make a directory (mkdir)

## Do More

### The concept of a "path" might confuse you at this point. Don't worry. We'll do a lot more with them and then you'll get it.

### Make 20 other directories inside the temp directory in various levels. Go look at them with a graphical file browser.

    I ran mkdir tmp as part of the exercise. After following through the same names as the instruction
    I ran mkdir tmp/(names of twenty directories) which are all conveniently stored in the the tmp folder
    They can be graphically viewed by following this path:
    /Users/tommy.haggerty/workspace/davinci_coders_t3_2016/homework/learn_command_line_exercises
    

### Make a directory with a space in the name by putting quotes around it

    One of the folders was named with a space in it. To do this type
    mkdir tmp/"one more" using quotations. If you don't use quotations, mkdir would create
    two directories in tmp; one called one, and one called more.
