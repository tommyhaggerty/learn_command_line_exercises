# Chapter 12: View a File (less, more)

## Do More

### Open your text file again and repeatedly copy-paste the text so that it's about 50-100 lines long.

    I happen to have text wrangler so I did it in that, but good to know that rubymine has that
    functionality.

### Copy it to your temp directory again so you can look at it.

```
cp /Users/tommy.haggerty/Desktop/ex12.txt 
/Users/tommy.haggerty/workspace/davinci_coders_t3_2016/homework/learn_command_line_exercises/tmp

```    
### Now do the exercise again, but this time page through it. On Unix you use the spacebar and w (the letter w) to go down and up. Arrow keys also work. On Windows just hit spacebar to page through.

```
less ex12.txt
```
### Look at some of the empty files you created too.

```
less iamcool.txt
less uncool.txt
less neat.txt
```

### The cp command will overwrite files that already exist so be careful copying files around.
