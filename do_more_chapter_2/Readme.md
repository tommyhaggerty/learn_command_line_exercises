# Chapter 2: Paths, Folders, Directories (pwd)

## Do More

### Type `pwd` 20 more times and each time say "print working directory"

### Type `pwd` 20 more times and each time say "print working directory"

### Write down the path that this command gives you. Find it with your graphical file browser of choice.

    ran the command pwd 40-60 times while chanting 'print working directory' like some sort of mindless drone :)
    When I initially ran the the pwd command I was in the main directory, I changed to the learn_command_line_exercises
    folder. 
    
    /Users/tommy.haggerty/workspace/davinci_coders_t3_2016/homework/learn_command_line_exercises
    
    To navigate graphically I opened finder, opened workspace, davinci_coders_t3_2016, homework, finally
    learn_command_line_exercises

### No, seriously, type it 20 times and say it out loud. Sssh. Just do it.
