## Do More

### cd to the joe directory with one command.

    cd ~/workspace/davinci_coders_t3_2016/homework/learn_command_line_exercises/tmp/stuff/things/frank/joe/

### cd back to temp with one command, but not further above that.

    cd ../../../.. 
    pwd
    /Users/tommy.haggerty/workspace/davinci_coders_t3_2016/homework/learn_command_line_exercises/tmp

### Find out how to cd to your "home directory" with one command.

    cd

### cd to your Documents directory, then find it with your GUI file browser (Finder, Windows Explorer, etc.).

    From home dir
    cd Documents
 
### cd to your Downloads directory, then find it with your file browser.

    cd back to home then cd Downloads 
    or
    cd ~/Downloads

### Find another directory with your file browser, then cd to it.

    cd ~/Documents/Pics/"Blog Pics"/

### Remember when you put quotes around a directory with spaces in it? You can do that with any command. For example, if you have a directory I Have Fun, then you can do: cd "I Have Fun"

    cd ~/Documents/Pics/"Blog Pics"/
