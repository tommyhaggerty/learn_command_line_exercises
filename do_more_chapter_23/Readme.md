# Chapter 23: Exiting your Terminal (exit)

## Do More

###  For your last set of exercises I'm going to have you use the help system to look up a set of commands you should research and learn how to use on your own.
    

| Command  | What the command does                            |
| -------- |:------------------------------------------------:|
| xargs    | - construct argument list(s) and execute utility |
| sudo     | - execute a command as another user              |
| chmod    | - change file modes or Access Control Lists      |
| chown    | - change owner and group of a file               |
