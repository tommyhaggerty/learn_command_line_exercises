# Chapter 7: Remove Directory (rmdir)

## Do More

### Make 20 more directories and remove them all.

    I used mkdir <directory_name> to create multiple directories after I created the directories I went through 
    and used rmdir <directory_name> to remove the directories. 

### Make a single path of directories that is 10 deep and remove them one at a time just like I did above.

    I made a directory 10 deep with mkdir <directory_name> followed by cd <directory_name> repeat.
    I then used cd .. to back up one directory and followed that with ls to get the directory_name. 
    I then used rmdir <directory_name> to remove the directory. I then repeated this process till I was 
    back in the tmp directory.

### If you try to remove a directory with contents you will get an error. I'll show you how to remove these in later exercises.
