# Chapter 7: Remove Directory (rmdir)

## Do More

### Make 20 more directories and remove them all.

    I used mkdir <filename> to create multiple files after I created the files I went through and used rmdir <filename>
    to remove the files. 

### Make a single path of directories that is 10 deep and remove them one at a time just like I did above.

    I made a directory 10 files deep with mkdir <filename> followed by cd <filename> repeat.
    I then used cd .. to back up one file and followed that with ls to get the filename. I then used rmdir <filename>
    to remove the file. I then repeated this process till I was back in the tmp directory.

### If you try to remove a directory with contents you will get an error. I'll show you how to remove these in later exercises.
