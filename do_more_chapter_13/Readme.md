# Chapter 13: Stream a file (cat)

## Do More

### Make a few more text files and work with cat.

    To do this I went into Rubymine to a desired directory. I hit command+N and created a 
    new .txt file. I added some lines of text to it and saved it. I then updated git with the 
    new file as well.

### Unix: Try cat ex12.txt ex13.txt and see what it does.

```
cat ex12.txt ex13.txt
```
Calls both files and runs them back to back on the screen. Since I am using cat to do this, there
is no paging it just puts all the info on the screen one file after another.
